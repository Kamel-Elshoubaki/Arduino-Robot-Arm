# Arduino-Robot-Arm
Steps of Assemply of the Robotic Arm
1-	After download the parts of robotic arduino arm from GitHub.com/smart-methods/, I found the parts in stl shape. So, I make some modifications of the stl files to be able to make the assembly in Solidworks program.
2-	After making the modifications, I started to make a new assembly file. 
3-	I started first insert the base.
4-	Then, insert the wrist and mate it on the face of the base to be two faces coincident of each other and to be the circle of the upper face of the base and the circle of the lower face of the wrist concentric.
5-	Then, insert the arm#1 and mate a hole of the arm#1 to the hole of the wrist concentric and to be two faces coincident of each other.
6-	Then, insert the arm#2 and mate a hole of the arm#2 to the hole of the arm#1 concentric and to be two faces coincident of each other.
7-	Then, insert the gripper and mate a hole of the gripper to the hole of the arm#2 concentric and to be two faces coincident of each other.
